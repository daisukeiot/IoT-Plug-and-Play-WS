# IoT Plug and Play

In this lab, we will :

1. [Prepare development environment (your PC) for IoT Plug and Play development](IoT-PnP-Prep.md)
1. [Generate Code Stub with Device Capability Model in Visual Studio Code](IoT-PnP-CodeGen.md)
1. [Compile](IoT-PnP-Compile.md) the code stub
1. Connect to IoT Central : Cloud First provisioning
    - [Manual operation](IoT-PnP-DeviceIdentity-Manual.md)
    - [With RESTful API](IoT-PnP-DeviceIdentity-API.md)
1. Connect to IoT Central : [Device First provisioning](IoT-PnP-DeviceFirstProvisioning.md)
1. [Add device specific code](IoT-PnP-DeviceSpecificCode.md) to make fully functional device application
